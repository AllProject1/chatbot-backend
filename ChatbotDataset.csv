Question,Answer
What is a rational number?,"A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. In other words, a rational number is of the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0."
What is the difference between a rational number and an irrational number?,"A rational number is any number that can be expressed as a fraction (p/q) where p and q are integers, and q ≠ 0. Rational numbers can have terminating or repeating decimal expansions. An irrational number, on the other hand, cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers, and its decimal expansion is non-terminating and non-repeating (e.g., √2, π)."
What is the additive inverse of a rational number?,"The additive inverse of a rational number is the number that, when added to the original number, gives the sum of zero. For example, the additive inverse of 7/9 is -7/9 because 7/9 + (-7/9) = 0."
Is the sum of two rational numbers always rational?,"Yes, the sum of two rational numbers is always rational. This is because the sum of two fractions can always be written as a fraction with integers in the numerator and denominator, where the denominator is not zero."
Can a rational number have a terminating decimal expansion?,"Yes, a rational number can have a terminating decimal expansion. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction (in its simplest form) has only 2 and/or 5 as its prime factors. For example, 1/8 = 0.125, which is a terminating decimal."
Can a rational number have a repeating decimal expansion?,"Yes, a rational number can have a repeating decimal expansion. This occurs when the denominator of the fraction (in its simplest form) has prime factors other than just 2 and 5. For example, 1/3 = 0.333..., which is a repeating decimal."
Is -5/9 a rational number? Explain.,"Yes, -5/9 is a rational number because it can be expressed as the fraction -5/9, where both -5 (numerator) and 9 (denominator) are integers, and the denominator is not zero."
What is the decimal representation of 5/8?,"The decimal representation of 5/8 is 0.625. This is a terminating decimal."
What is the relationship between rational numbers and integers?,"All integers are rational numbers because they can be expressed as a fraction with a denominator of 1. For example, 3 can be written as 3/1, which is a rational number."
What is the multiplicative inverse of a rational number?,"The multiplicative inverse (or reciprocal) of a rational number is the number that, when multiplied by the original number, gives the product of 1. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 3/5 is 5/3, because (3/5) * (5/3) = 1."
How do you represent 11/2 on a number line?,"1. Understand the fraction: 11/2 is an improper fraction. This means that 11 is bigger than 2. We can convert this improper fraction into a mixed number.
